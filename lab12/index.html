		<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Working with a partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Figuring how to get the hash function to work with my code took a few minutes, and I had some difficulty getting the extra descriptive text in there as smoothly as possible.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I've made a program that still uses a conditional while an array and index replaces the conditional from the initial instructions.</p>
