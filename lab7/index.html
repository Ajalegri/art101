		<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
		<h2>Big Idea</h2>
		<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I had to look up a bunch of stuff in order to do the bonus suggestions.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I had some bugs mainly stemming from typos, but those were easy to fix. I tried to ensure the output array was different from the input with a while loop, but that kept making the page crash so I gave up on it.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I've made a name randomizer that is case and space insensitive, and outputs with correct capitalization!</p>
