			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi!! I'm Tony (he/him), a 5th year Game Design (AGPM) major, focusing on music and writing. I really like RPGs and kinda have a DnD addiction lol. I have some experience with coding, but haven't really done much of it for a few years, so I'm pretty rusty. (if any of you know the capstone games from last year, I worked on The Adventurer's Guild!)</p>
